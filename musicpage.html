            <h2>Notes Names</h2>

            <p>In the world of music, notes are named as letters, starting at A, 
                and going up to G (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). The only other detail you 
                would need to know about note names is that there is an additional 
                note in between every note mentioned above. If you’ve seen black keys
                on a piano, you’ve seen these “in between” notes. We call these Sharps 
                (#)/Flats (b). Sharp means “up”, flat means “down”. For example, the note
                between A and B is a little higher (“up”) than A, but a little lower (“down”) 
                than B. That note is called A#, or Bb. That’s right, A# and Bb are the exact 
                same note! There’s even better news, B and C and E and F don’t have any “in between” notes.
                In other words, just about every song you have ever heard uses a combination of these twelve
                notes: A, A#/ Bb, B, C, C#/ Db, D, D#/ Eb, E, F, F#/ Gb, G, G#/ Ab. Everything else on this 
                page will help you organize and recognize these notes to help you learn/ make any song you could imagine! </p>

            <h2> Scales</h2>
            <p>Scales are very simple, in fact, you only need to learn one to learn all the other 143 standard scales! 
                I know that sounds like a lot, but like I said, once you learn one, the rest follow the same formula. 
                To learn this the easiest way, we’ll learn half and whole steps. Half steps mean “play the next immediate note”. 
                So, a half step up from A would be A#. Whole steps skip a note: AàB (A skips A# and goes straight to B. 
                With that information, to make our first 12 scales (IMPORTANT: About half of the songs in the world use this formula!), 
                we will use this formula to make these scales (oh and by the way: W = Whole Step; H = Half Step): W-W-H-W-W-W-H. 
                That’s it and yes: it is that simple! That formula tied with our next topic is all you need to make and learn any song! 
                A great example of this formula is the C major scale: C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C. Try learning the G major and F major scales!
                 ALL the other scales we spoke about before use the same formula, but we’ll talk about that later.
                  For now, go practice those scales on your instrument of choice! </p>

            <h2>Intervals</h2>

            <p>Great! Now that you’ve practiced, how did it feel? It doesn’t make a lot of sense, huh? That’s okay!
            What just happened was that your brain took in all the information and now needs to learn how to put it into practice. 
            Well, the good news is that the hard part is now over. Everything else we talk about from now on will be focused on scales.
            So please, make it a priority to start learning those first. Intervals are easy, just count the notes in a scale. 
            Each scale has 8 notes. The first note is called a 1st. The second is called a 2nd. The third is called a 3rd. 
            Yeah, can you guess what the 4th note is called? What about the 5th? 6th? 7th? And the last note (remember, there are only 8 notes)? 
            All songs are built on intervals. Just like scales organize note names to make them easier to use, our next section will help us organize intervals to make them easier to use! </p>

            <h2>Chords</h2>

            <p>Still feel like it’s all going over your head? Here’s a tip: Take a nap! 
            Yep, go get some sleep! When we sleep, our brains are much more efficient
            at processing and saving information to keep it from getting away. 
            Come back once you’ve gotten some sleep because our next topic is even easier than intervals as long you understand scales. </p>

         <

         <p>Now that you’ve been able to get some sleep, let’s talk about chords! Chords are even easier than intervals! 
            Standard chords (the ones you find in everyday music) just skip every other note in the scale. 
            For example, the C major scale takes the scale we talked about before (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C) skips every other note: C-E-G. 
            Now play those three notes together. Sounds pretty, doesn’t it? You don’t have to stop at 3 notes either, 
            but for now, we’ll stop there. So go ahead, start skipping notes! See how many chords you can make with all the scales you’ve practiced so far! </p>

        <section class="Card">
            <h2>Chord Progressions</h2>
          
            <p>For this topic, you won’t need to learn any new chords. Chord progressions are just the order in which we play chords to evoke different emotions. 
            When we speak of chords in this sense, you’ll first get the interval to start on (1st, 2nd 3rd…), and you’ll play every other note after that initial note. 
            For example: In the C major scale, (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C) starting on the sixth note, play a chord (AKA the 6th chord). A-C-E should be your answer. Next, play the 4th chord. 
            F-A-C should be your answer. Now play the 1st chord (we played this one last time!). Finally, end on the 5th chord. 
            These 4 chords constitute the vast majority of modern music and this chord progression (the order the chords are in) meaning that theres a good chance you can play your favorite songs using a variation of this progression! </p>

            <h2>Your Musical Journey</h2>
            <p>From here on out you can take what you have learned about chords and melodies (intervals) and learn all your favorite songs and even start making your own. 
            Some good resources that have helped me learn and grow as a musician are MuseScore, Ultimate Guitar, and Songsterr. Now go enjoy becoming the next superstar! </p>
